# DSAIT4020
This is the final project for course DSAIT4020.

__Our work can be mainly divided into three part:__
1. Explore the data using clustering methods.
2. Explore the data using classification methods.
3. Implement model to predict matches.

__Here are the list of the files and their descriptions. The files with * are important files:__

__feature_importance_plots__ &nbsp; Figures describing the importance of the features

__old__ &nbsp; Old files that can be ignore

__preprocessed_data*__ &nbsp; Preprocessed data generated by preprocessing.ipynb, used by clusteing.ipynb and PredictionModel.ipynb

__results__ &nbsp; Folder used for saving figures

__src*__ &nbsp; Containing all the code for the sescond part: classification methods

__clustering*__ &nbsp; Containing all the code for the first part: clustering methods

__PredictionModel*__ &nbsp; Containing all the code for the third part: model predicts matches

__preprocessing*__ &nbsp; Containing the common data preprocessing steps and preprocessing for prediction model

__speed-dating*__ &nbsp; The original dataset
